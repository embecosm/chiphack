# Minimal EDSAC

Richard Miller's reimplementation of Bill Purvis's Mini-EDSAC for MyStorm,
in a stripped-down minimal form to simplify plugging in different versions
of I/O, memory etc. 

This version uses Bill's reduced EDSAC instruction set, initial orders and
example "squares" program; the rest is new.

No separate server program -- for a demo (in linux) just run "make input"
in one window and "make test" in another.
