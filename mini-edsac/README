This is the extended Mini-EDSAC implementation for the
MyStorm BlackIce board. This implements the basic Mini-EDSAC
as used at ChipHack 2017, with extensions as proposed in my
talk to add the B-Line register and associated orders.

The Makefile should compile the code ready for downloading
to the BlackIce board. You can type either:
   make mini	to make the basic (without extensions)
or
   make minib	to make it with the extensions.

To run it you need to run miniserve on the PC (or Mac).
That now lives in a separate folder (Programs) along with
test and demo programs.

Upload the binary with either:
       make upload     for the basic version, or
       make uploadb    for the exetnded version

To run the squares demo, cd to the Programs folder and
run:
	./miniserve -t squares.txt

Have fun!
